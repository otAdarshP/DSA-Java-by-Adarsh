 Bubble sort is the technique of comparing the adjacent elements
 (taken as i being the start (0) and j as the internal loop for traversing between all the elements.
 We compare the elements at index 1 and 2 (i and j), and check, if the element at index 1 is larger than the element at index 2,
 or -
 if " i > i + 1", we swap the elements, and do this till all the elements are swapped.
 This technique is also followed in In-place pattern as the space complexity is O(1).

 Eg: 3, 1, 4, 5, 2
 this eg. at the 1st iteration would become:
 1, 3, 4, 2, 5
 2nd iteration:
 1, 3, 2, 4, 5
 3rd iteration:
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> finally sorted in the bubble away.
 Checks the element from the start of the indexes everytime

OR : AFTER EVERY ITERATION, THE LARGEST ELEMENT IN THE ARRAYLIST COMES AT THE END

 Bubble sort is also known as Sinking sort and exchange sort.
