Check -> Swap -> Change.
The functioning of the cyclic sort depends on checking if the value at index i is at its correct index or not, if not at the correct index,
it should be swapped with the value at that correct index, and then verified, if the value at i is at the correct index (arr[i]-1) or not.
This is known as Cyclic Sorting - generally used when given continuous elements / elements in orer of 1 to N.

    WHEN THE RANGE GIVEN IS:-
    1 to N (1, n) => int correct = nums[i] - 1;
    or in some cases,
    0 to N (0, n) => int correct = nums[i];
    -- In such cases, we can use the Cyclic Sort method.

    VALUE - 1 == INDEX  --- This is the condition for Cyclic sort checking
